# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering and building open-source standards for the broader community both maintainers and contributors pledge to make participation to the NFTDelegation project and the community around it a harassment-free experience for everyone, **irrespective of:** age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Let's build for the community!

## Our Standards

Let's foster a positive environment by:

>* Using welcoming and inclusive language
>* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and opinions
>* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
>* Focusing on what is best for the project and the community
>* Showing empathy towards other community members

Let's avoid unacceptable behaviour, such as:

>* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
>* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
>* Public or private harassment
>* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
>* Any other type of conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Maintainers of the project are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective judgements and take actions in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within the project's space, but also in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation for the project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting:
* on Twitter [@punk6529](https://twitter.com/punk6529) or Discord [6529#4247](https://discord.com/users/6529#4247) - Project Initiator
* on Discord [skynet2030#8875](https://discord.com/users/skynet2030#8875)  - Project Maintainer

All cases on reposted complaints will be reviewed and investigated and result in a response or corrective action(s) deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. _By default confidentiality in regards to the reporter of an incident will be maintained_. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
