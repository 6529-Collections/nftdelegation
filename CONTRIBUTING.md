# Contributing Guide

Welcome! Thank you for considering making a contribution to the nftdelegation repository. This guide will help you find the right approach.

## Getting Started

When contributing to the nftdelegation repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue.

## Issues

Issues should be used to report bugs, suggest a fix, propose a new feature, or to discuss potential changes.

## Pull Requests

In general, each PR should:

- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible
- Add or update tests for fixed or changed functionality
- Address whitespace/style issues in standalone PRs, not combined with other changes

For changes that address core functionality, or would require breaking changes, it's best to open an issue to discuss your proposal first.

## Maintainers

Maintainers actively support the project, have admin access to the repo, and review issues and pull requests.
