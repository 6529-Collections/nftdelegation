:+1::tada: Welcome! and thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the project, which are hosted at [NFTDelegation](https://github.com/6529-Collections/nftdelegation). These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes using pull requests.


## Code of Conduct

Let's respect everyone participating to this project and promote a harassment-free experience for everyone. NFTDelegation is governed by the following[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

When contributing to the nftdelegation repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue.

## Issues

Issues should be used to report bugs, suggest a fix, propose a new feature, or to discuss potential changes.

## Pull Requests

In general, each PR should:

- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible
- Add or update tests for fixed or changed functionality
- Address whitespace/style issues in standalone PRs, not combined with other changes

For changes that address core functionality, or would require breaking changes, it's best to open an issue to discuss your proposal first.

## Maintainers

Maintainers actively support the project, have admin access to the repo, and review issues and pull requests.
